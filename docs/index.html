              <div class="line">
                <span class="body"> <p>No. We are non-theists who revere Satan as a fictional character representing the pursuit of truth, and rebellion from arbitrary authority. The symbolic Satan as portrayed in France’s Revolt of the Angels and Milton’s Paradise Lost are more appropriate for our deeply held beliefs.</p>

                <span class="body"> <p>No. We are first and foremost a religious organization, and we fight to defend our shared freedom of religion in the United States. Hating Christianity is not productive nor does it work to resolve the underlying issues of religious freedom and plurality.</p>

                <span class="body"> <p>All information about The Satanic Temple is readily available on the <a href="https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/learn">main TST website</a>. If you are looking for testimonials or to hear the story of TST, we recommend the documentary “Hail Satan?” which is now available on many streaming platforms and can be purchased online as well. In addition, many interviews and podcasts feature prominent voices within TST along with many interviews with our Co Founder and Spokesperson Lucien Greaves. While we appreciate that we are interesting to many, we are also a serious religious group. We do not want to be “humanized” for popular culture consumption.</p>

                <span class="body"> <p>The Satanic Temple is a religious group that will partake in social justice campaigns when necessary and when relevant. TST cannot, and will not, be a catch-all for major sociopolitical issues. While many members are independently involved in social justice work, a Satanic religious group may not be the best ally for many reasons. It is also impossible for TST to have involvement in many causes as we are entirely volunteer run, and our members also have jobs and families. Perhaps as time progresses and TST can establish a better foothold in the public sphere this may change, but for now we ask for understanding that TST cannot tackle every cause.</p>

                <span class="body"> <p>While we are just as excited as anyone for the documentary to tell the story of The Satanic Temple, joining a chapter is much more work. We require that our chapter members identify as Satanist, or have done their research beyond simply watching a documentary. One does not watch a Wrestling match and then decide to become a professional wrestler the next day! To join a chapter means that you are willing to assume the risks involved with being a Satanist- and we expect our chapter members to devote time and effort to local and national goals and objectives. If you feel that you have done your research and are willing to accept a role within the organization, you can find our chapter membership application below.</p>
